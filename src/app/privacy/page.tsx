              <p className="mb-3">
                Cookies are small text files stored on your computer&apos;s browser directory or program data subfolders. They are created when you visit a website that uses cookies to keep track of your movements within the site, help you resume where you left off, remember your login, theme selection, preferences, and other customisation functions.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-3">
                Cookies are often indispensable for websites that have large databases, need logins, have customisable themes, and other advanced features. Cookies usually don&apos;t contain much information except for the URL of the website that created the cookie, the duration of the cookie&apos;s abilities and effects, and a random number.

                There are two types of cookies: <strong>session cookies</strong> and <strong>persistent cookies</strong>. Session cookies are created temporarily while you visit a website and are deleted when you leave. Persistent cookies remain in your browser&apos;s subfolder for the duration set within the cookie&apos;s file and are activated again when you revisit the website.
