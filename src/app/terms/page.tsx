                The products offered for sale are those featured on the website on the day of your visit. If a product is not available, you will be informed at the latest when the order is delivered.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-3">
                All prices are indicated in Euros and include VAT where applicable. We reserve the right to modify prices at any time; products will be billed at the price valid when the order was confirmed, subject to availability.
